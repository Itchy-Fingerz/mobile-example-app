 The SLGeoMessenger protocol provides support for manageing the GeoMessenger service. This protocol enables starting and stopping of the service and while the service is started, it can also provide all the GeoMessenger zones the device is currently in. For continous updates about GeoMessenger, use SLGeoMessengerDelegate and add your delegate with this protocol. This will enables direct callbacks when entering and leaving zones.
 
 ### Note
 
 This protocol and its service can only be used when SLIndoorLocationManager is started, and you have got a callback to [SLIndoorLocationManagerDelegate didFinishLoadingManager]. Also, do not forget to stop the service when you do not want to use it any more, e.g. when navigating away from the map.
