## Setup

1.  Open a Git Bash (MinGW) terminal for the following commands.
2.  In the root of the repo, run the command `./update.platform.sh -p windows` to download the latest eeGeo Windows SDK.
	*	We recommend you run this step frequently to keep your SDK version up to date.
3.  In the `windows` directory, run `mkdir build` to create a build directory.
4.  In the `windows/build` directory, run `cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" ..` to generate a project file.
5.  Open the `ExampleApp.sln` project file in Visual Studio.
6.  Right-click the ExampleAppWPF project and select `Set as StartUp Project`.
